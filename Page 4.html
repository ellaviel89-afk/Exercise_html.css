                    <h3>MY REFLECTION</h3>
                    <p>In my activity on lists, images, video, and audio in web design, I learned how these elements make a webpage more engaging and informative. Lists help organize information clearly, while images add visual interest and support the content. I also discovered how inserting videos and audio can make a webpage more interactive and appealing to users. This activity taught me the importance of combining different media elements to create a more complete and dynamic web experience. Overall, I realized that using these features correctly can greatly improve both the design and functionality of a webpage.</p>
