    <h1>EFFECTS OF DETASSELING ON CORN YIELD PRODUCTION</h1>
    <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <h4>Nature and importance of the study</h4>


    <body>
   
        <p>
          Corn (Zea maize L) ranks next to rice as the stable food crop in the philippines. About 85% of our total corn production is consumed as human food. The rest is used for livestock, poultry and swine feeds. Corn can also be used in our industry in the manufacture, of corn by products (Book of Knowledge, 1996).</p>     
        <p>
          Corn in the philippines can be planted depending upon the season; from October to December (dry season); April to June (rainy season); or from December to February (third crop). However, corn growth is preferable in low land or sloping site particularly in the Kaingin System (Jack Kramer 2005).</p>
        <p>
          Corn plant has a perfect flower. However, the male (tassel) and female (silk) flowers were found separately in one plant. This study will venture on on the removal of the male flower (tassel) of corn plant at the tasseling stage and determined if tassel removal had a direct effect on the yield performance of corn at harvest time. Under Calbayog condition no study has been yet conducted in this aspect thus, this study is trongly proposed.</p>
      
     <h4>Objectives</h4>
     <p>
         This study was conducted specifically to:
         <p>1. Determine the yield performance of corn as affected by detasseling;</p>
         <p>2. Evaluate the effects of the frequency of detasseling on the yield performance of corn plant; and</p>
         <p>3. Compare the economic returns of growing corn as affected by detasseling.</p>
       
     <h4>Scope and Limitations</h4>
         <p>
           This study was limited only on the effects of detasseling on the yield of corn. The corn variety used in this study was white corn. This was conducted at Brgy. Dagum, Calbayog City.</p>
       
     <h4>Time and Place of the study</h4>
         <p>This study was conducted at Brgy. Dagum, Purok 3, Calbayog City starting from April 14, 2007 up to July 6, 2007. </p>
